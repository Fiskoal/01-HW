# HW-1-Accessability
### I realize I probably should've pushed the original files to be able to show exactly what I changed, I will do that in the future.

For this homework, I did not have to do way too much.
The "client" wanted to improve the accessability of the website, which includes cleaning up elements as well as the css.

The website used <div> containers for just about EVERYTHING. I had to specify their <nav>, <main>, <footer>, as well as <sections>.
They had specific classes/ids attatched to almost every <div> as well.
Added and id to one <p> that was missing it, but was hyperlinked in <nav>
  
They were also way too specific in the css, partially due to over-use of <div> elements and classes/ids, so I broke down a lot of it and made it much more manageable/readable overall, as going into it to change or update it in the future would've been more of an issue than it, theoretically, had to be.
  
I also added alt tags to the images.
